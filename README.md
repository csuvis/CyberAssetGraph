# An open dataset of Cyber Asset Graphs for Cybercrime Research(CAG-CR-22) 

The internet ecosystem is being severely disrupted by cybercrime gangs, such as online gambling and online drug trafficking. Various cyber assets, such as websites, domains, IPs, and SSL certificates, are fundamental to support cybercrime activities. Deactivating and banning cyber assets are widely-used manners to fight against cybercrimes. However, peripheral assets, such as websites and domains, are accessible but low-value targets for cybercrime fighting due to their easy replicability and replaceability. Core assets associated with numerous peripheral assets, are valuable targets but their information is generally hidden and scattered in heterogeneous online data sources. 

CyberAssetGraphData is a large-scale cyber asset graph dataset, aiming to promote the development and innovation of advanced data analysis technologies for cybercrime fighting. The dataset is constructed by mining and integrating the information of and associations between cyber assets of cybercrime gangs from heterogeneous online data sources. The dataset has 8 types of cyber assets (nodes) and 11 types of relations (edges) between cyber assets. The dataset contains 2.37 million nodes and 3.28 million edges. 


More information about the dataset is available in supplement materials.
