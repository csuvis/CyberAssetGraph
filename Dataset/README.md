This folder provides the CAG-CR-22 dataset in CSV format. It contains a Node.zip and a Link.zip files that record the information about nodes and edges, respectively.
This folder also provides some examples of CAGs mined in the dataset in CAG Samples.zip file. To reduce the visual clutter of CAG visualization result, we only preserve a part of the isomorphic neighbor nodes of the center node of a star-like cluster using a random sampling method. Moreover, the CAG Samples.zip file only stores the node id of the CAGs, please refer to the Node.zip file for more information.
